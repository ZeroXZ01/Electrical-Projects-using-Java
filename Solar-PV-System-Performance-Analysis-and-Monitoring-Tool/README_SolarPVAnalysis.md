# Solar PV System Performance Analysis Tool in Java

This project provides a Java-based tool for analyzing the performance of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system using simulated or recorded data. It loads data from a CSV file, calculates key performance indicators such as DC power output and a simplified system efficiency, and visualizes these metrics against irradiance and time using JFreeChart.

## Key Features

* **CSV Data Loading:** Reads PV system data from a comma-separated value (CSV) file. The expected CSV format includes columns for timestamp, irradiance, panel temperature, voltage, current, and load power.
* **DC Power Calculation:** Calculates the instantaneous DC power output of the PV system.
* **Simplified Efficiency Calculation:** Estimates the system's efficiency by comparing the DC power output per panel area to the incident solar irradiance.
* **Data Visualization:** Generates three key plots using the JFreeChart library:
    * **DC Power vs. Irradiance:** A scatter plot showing the relationship between solar irradiance and the generated DC power.
    * **Power Generation vs. Consumption Over Time:** A time series chart comparing the DC power generated by the PV system with the load power consumption over the recorded period.
    * **Simplified Efficiency Over Time:** A time series chart illustrating how the calculated efficiency of the PV system changes over time.

## Equations Used in the Analysis

The core calculations performed by this tool involve determining the DC power output and a simplified system efficiency.

**1. DC Power Output ($P_{DC}$):**
The instantaneous DC power generated by the solar PV system is calculated by multiplying the measured voltage ($V$) and current ($I$) at the output of the PV array:
$$P_{DC} = V \times I$$
where:
* $P_{DC}$ is the DC power in Watts (W).
* $V$ is the voltage in Volts (V).
* $I$ is the current in Amperes (A).

**2. Simplified System Efficiency ($\eta_{system}$):**
A simplified system efficiency is estimated by comparing the DC power output per unit panel area to the incident solar irradiance. This calculation provides a basic understanding of how effectively the solar energy is being converted into electrical energy.
$$\eta_{system} = \frac{P_{DC} / A_{panel}}{G} \times 100\%$$
where:
* $\eta_{system}$ is the simplified system efficiency in percent (%).
* $P_{DC}$ is the DC power output in Watts (W).
* $A_{panel}$ is the total area of the solar PV panels in square meters ($m^2$). This is a constant defined in the code.
* $G$ is the solar irradiance incident on the panels in Watts per square meter ($W/m^2$).

**Note:** This efficiency calculation is a simplification as it doesn't account for various losses in a real PV system, such as inverter losses, temperature effects on panel efficiency, wiring losses, and potential maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inefficiencies.

## Key Java Libraries Used

* **JFreeChart:** For creating the scatter plots and time series charts to visualize the PV system's performance data.
* **Java I/O:** (`java.io.BufferedReader`, `java.io.FileReader`, `java.io.IOException`) for reading data from the CSV file.
* **Java Time API:** (`java.time.LocalDateTime`, `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter`, `java.time.ZoneOffset`) for handling and parsing timestamp data from the CSV file and converting it to milliseconds for time-based plots.
* **Java Collections Framework:** (`java.util.ArrayList`, `java.util.List`) for storing the data read from the CSV file.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Install JFreeChart:** Ensure that the JFreeChart library (`jfreechart-1.5.4.jar` and `jcommon-1.0.23.jar` or the latest stable versions) are included in your project's classpath. If you are using a build tool like Maven, the `pom.xml` file is already configured to download these dependencies.
3.  **Prepare CSV Data:** Create a CSV file (e.g., `solar_data.csv` in the project root) with the following columns in order: `timestamp,irradiance (W/m^2),panel_temperature (Â°C),voltage (V),current (A),load_power (W)`. The timestamp should be in the format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`. An example dummy CSV is generated if the file doesn't exist.
4.  **Compile:** Compile the `SolarPVAnalysis.java` file using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac SolarPVAnalysis.java`).
5.  **Run:** Execute the `main` method of the `SolarPVAnalysis` class (e.g., `java SolarPVAnalysis`). A window will appear displaying the three analysis plots.

## Project Structure

* `SolarPVAnalysis.java`: Contains the main class with methods for loading data from the CSV file, calculating DC power and efficiency, and creating the performance plots using JFreeChart.

## Further Development

This tool can be expanded in several ways:

* **More Comprehensive Efficiency Calculation:** Incorporate factors like inverter efficiency, wiring losses, and temperature effects for a more accurate efficiency calculation.
* **Data Aggregation and Statistical Analysis:** Implement features to aggregate data over different time periods (e.g., hourly, daily) and perform statistical analysis (e.g., average power, peak power).
* **Real-time Data Monitoring:** Integrate with data acquisition systems to process and visualize real-time data from a live PV installation.
* **Performance Forecasting:** Implement basic forecasting models to predict future energy generation based on historical data and weather forecasts.
* **Customizable Plotting Options:** Allow users to customize the appearance of the plots and select different data to visualize.
* **Data Export:** Implement functionality to export the analyzed data and generated plots in various formats.
